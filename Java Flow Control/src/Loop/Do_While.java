    Java while loop

    Java while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met.
    The syntax of the while loop is:

    while (testExpression) {
        // body of loop
    }

    Here,
        1. A while loop evaluates the textExpression inside the parenthesis ().
        2. If the textExpression evaluates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed.
        3. The textExpression is evaluated again.
        4. This process continues until the textExpression is false.
        5. When the textExpression evaluates to false, the loop stops.
