    /*
    Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables. For example,

    int age;
    age = 5;

    Here, = is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left. That is, 5 is assigned to the variable age.
    Let's see some more assignment operators available in Java.

    Operator            Example          Equivalent to
    =                   a = b;              a = b;
    +=                  a += b;             a = a + b;
    -=                  a -= b;             a = a - b;
    *=                  a *= b;             a = a * b;
    /=                  a /= b;             a = a / b;
    %=                  a %= b;             a = a % b;

        // Assign the variable
        int a = 10;
