        It is important to note that the bitwise complement of any integer N is equal to - (N + 1). For example,
        Consider an integer 35. As per the rule, the bitwise complement of 35 should be -(35 + 1) = -36.

        35 = 00100011 (In Binary)
        // using bitwise complement operator
        ~ 00100011
        __________
          11011100
        In the above example, we get that the bitwise complement of 00100011 (35) is 11011100. Here, if we convert the result into decimal we get 220.
        However, it is important to note that we cannot directly convert the result into decimal and get the desired output.
        This is because the binary result 11011100 is also equivalent to -36.
        To understand this we first need to calculate the binary output of -36.

        2's Complement
        In binary arithmetic, we can calculate the binary negative of an integer using 2's complement.
        1's complement changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. And, if we add 1 to the result of the 1's complement,
        we get the 2's complement of the original number. For example,

        // compute the 2's complement of 36
        36 = 00100100 (In Binary)

        1's complement = 11011011

        2's complement:
          11011011
             +   1
         _________
          11011100

        Here, we can see the 2's complement of 36 (i.e. -36) is 11011100.
        This value is equivalent to the bitwise complement of 35.
        Hence, we can say that the bitwise complement of 35 is -(35 + 1) = -36.
